This project demonstrates a full stack web-app utilizing a MySQL database to form diet plans to accomodate various users.

Users can recieve back dietplans and get calculations on how long it will take them to reach a healthy target weight. On startup, the user only needs to enter their body measurements to determine which diet plan to maintain a health BMI. The user will also be asked to enter any dietary restrictions.

Users can also save custom diet plans to the database.
